                    A healthy lifestyle can help you thrive throughout your life.
                    Making healthy choices isn't always easy, however. It can be hard to find the time and energy to exercise regularly or prepare healthy meals.
                    However, your efforts will pay off in many ways, and for the rest of your life.

                    <ol class="order-list">
                        <li>Be physically active for 30 minutes most days of the week. Break this up into three 10-minute sessions when pressed for time. Healthy movement may include walking, sports, dancing, yoga, running or other activities you enjoy.</li>
                        <li>Eat a well-balanced, low-fat diet with lots of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Choose a diet that's low in saturated fat and cholesterol, and moderate in sugar, salt and total fat.</li>
                        <li>Avoid injury by wearing seatbelts and bike helmets, using smoke and carbon monoxide detectors in the home, and using street smarts when walking alone. If you own a gun, recognize the dangers of having a gun in your home. Use safety precautions at all times.</li>
